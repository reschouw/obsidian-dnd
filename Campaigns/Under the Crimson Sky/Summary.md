# Villain
*Who is a worthy BBEG?*

Thaddeus Kayne: Buried deep in a crypt a millenia ago, treasure hunters uncovered his sarcophagus and freed him. He now seeks revenge against the city-states. 

# The Plan
*Someone wants something by sometime using some tools, but is having trouble getting it because of reasons.*

Thaddeus wants to raze the city states to the ground, but they are still powerful enough to stop him and his armies, and he has to summon the armies to begin with. 

# The Steps
*Probably three?*

## 1. Weaken the alliance
Kayne will enthrall key members of the political leaders of the  city states. Maybe even lower level diplomats, etc. They will start causing arguments and rifts between the city states. Maybe start border skirmishes.

## 2. Raise the old armies
Kayne must also raise the old armies back into service once again. To do so, he must visit the sites of the old battles and press the dead back into service. They may not all go willingly, so he will have to force some of them. 

# 3. March on the city states
Once the armies are raised and the city states are bickering, Kayne will form up his battalions, assign them missions of destruction, and issue his orders. The armies will lay siege to the city states themselves, raid villages and burn towns.

The most populous of the three city-states, Newrock provided the majority of the soldiers  during the dark times. It also suffered the worst casualties. It has since become a gleaming metropolis, although not all those who live in the city share in it's wealth.

**Leveraging Military Might (with a twist):** Despite their arrogance, Newrock still possesses a strong martial tradition. They might initially favor a direct military confrontation with the vampire, underestimating their magical prowess. However, they could be crucial in defending strategic locations or leading assaults if their pride can be channeled effectively. Perhaps a charismatic leader could rise and remind them of the true cost of the last war and the importance of humility and cooperation.

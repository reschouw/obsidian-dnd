Despite being the smallest of the three city-states by far, Southfield's magicians provided a great deal of power to the allied forces. Unfortunately, the town is now plauged by the results of their tainted magiks. 

**Harnessing Tainted Magic for Defense:** The dark magic plaguing Southfield could potentially be turned into a weapon against the vampire or the ancient evil, but this would be a risky path. Perhaps their mages have developed unique wards or spells to contain or even redirect negative energies. They might be hesitant to use such magic, fearing further corruption, leading to internal conflict and ethical dilemmas.

**Studying the Nature of the Ancient Evil (Through a Dark Lens):** Southfield's mages, having delved into darker arts, might possess a unique, albeit dangerous, understanding of the ancient evil's essence and how it was originally contained. They might believe that "fighting fire with fire" is necessary, researching forbidden texts and experimenting with controlled dark magic to find a vulnerability or a way to counteract the ancient evil's influence. This approach could be morally ambiguous and deeply unsettling to the other city-states.

At the heart of the city stands **The Lyceum of Resonant Song**, one of the oldest and most prestigious bard colleges in the realm. Its magnificent halls are said to be enchanted to hold the echo of every masterpiece ever performed within its walls. The Lyceum’s masters are not just musicians; they are scholars of sound, capable of understanding its physical and magical properties.

Now, however, a profound unease has settled over Veridia. The city that once took pride in its constant chorus is becoming fearful of it. The first grim portents of An-Yin's magic are being felt here more acutely than anywhere else. Whispers of musicians going missing or being unjustly imprisoned have begun to spread, and the city’s leadership is struggling to contain the growing panic. The very essence of Veridia is now what makes it most vulnerable.

There may be some records of An-Yin's time at the college, and what drove him mad. 

There may be witnesses to An-Yin's crimes at the college, but they may also be unable to speak.

# Hook
Save the world from being permanently silenced.

# Truths
*What separates this campaign from all others?*
*These will be shared with the players*
1. Veridia is a well-known place of pilgrimage for musicians of all kinds, and is home to one of the oldest and most renown bardic colleges.
2. Something has the spellcasters of Veridia being even more paranoid than usual. They aren't talking about what it is.
3. Ghost stories are unusually common in this part of the world. Many are dismissed as blatant exaggerations. Others are treated with genuine fear.
4. There are rumors of farmhouses decaying and disappearing into dust around the city. 
5. The Great Bell of Veridia, the symbol of city for a millennia, has recently failed to make a sound.
6. The relationship between the townspeople and the college has always been strained. 

# Fronts
*Defined as a name, a goal, and three grim portents*

An-Yin (Silence the city):
- **The City's Chorus Fades.** Random, localized pockets of silence begin to appear throughout the city. The laughter of a group of children, the bell of a local church, or the bustling sounds of a market street suddenly vanish, only to be replaced by an unnerving and complete quiet. These are at first dismissed as strange occurrences, but they are An-Yin's initial tests of his power.
- **The City's Harmony Cracks.** An-Yin's music targets a significant public figure or institution. The city's Arch-Librarian, a famous oracle, or the master of the local Bardic college is publicly silenced and begins to turn to dust, as if to make an example. This event shatters any remaining hope that the silence is just a strange phenomenon, sending the city into a panic.
- **The Final Crescendo.** An-Yin performs a final, devastating concert from the highest point in the city (e.g., the spire of a cathedral or a wizard's tower). His pipa music creates a growing, malevolent sphere of silence that expands to consume the entire city. Once the sphere closes, the entire city is permanently silenced, and all inside are doomed to a slow decay.

# Setting
*Government? Economy? How did it get to be this way?*
Veridia
Well known as a place of pilgrimage for musicians and poets of all kinds, it is also home of one of the oldest and most prestidgious bard colleges in the realm: **The Lyceum of Resonant Song**. 
# Villain
*Who is a worthy BBEG?*

An-Yin: An ancient, immortal musician, seeking the perfect note. Driven mad by his pursuit, he seeks to silence all other sound in the world in order to pursue his perfect note. 

*Note that An-Yin is be a combination of Chinese characters meaning "peace" and "sound. An awesome contradiction*

# The Plan
*Someone wants something by sometime using some tools, but is having trouble getting it because of reasons.*
An-Yin wants find the perfect, divine note using his pipa, but cannot find it because there are other sounds distracting and distorting his practice. 

# The Steps
*Probably three?*
1. **The Beggar's Tune:** An-Yin arrives in Veridia and begins to practice his dark music by posing as a humble begging musician. He chooses busy street corners and market squares, playing a simple, yet subtly malevolent tune. Those who linger near him feel a growing unease, and the sounds of the city around them become distorted and muffled. He is using this time to subtly corrupt the sound of the city and perfect his craft, all while remaining unnoticed by the general populace.
    
- **The Concert of Shattered Strings:** Once his power is perfected, An-Yin sheds his beggar persona and stages a public concert in a prominent city location. This is the moment the town realizes the true nature of the threat. Using his music, he manifests the ethereal blades and mummies of his deadly style, turning his victims to dust and making a horrifying example of them. This act shatters the city's morale and confirms to everyone that they are under deliberate attack.
    
- **The Bell's Last Ring:** For his final, city-wide silencing ritual, An-Yin must destroy the city's core identity. He will corrupt and use the city's Great Bell, a symbol of Veridia's sound for a millennium. By playing a single, dissonant chord, he will trigger a resonance cascade. As the cascade spreads, the echoes of every masterpiece ever performed within the city are violently twisted and consumed, becoming fuel for the spell. The echoes of his own music then fill their place, silencing Veridia forever.

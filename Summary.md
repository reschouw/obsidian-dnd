# Spark

An old man sits alone behind a massive mahogany desk in a windowless room. The desk is scattered with maps, candles, and crystal decanter of amber liquid. He sits with his head in his hands, as a rumbling in the distance causes ripples in the decanter. 

He sighs, 

He wets his quill, scratches a signature into the parchment before him, and leans back into his chair. The parchment begins to smolder and burn. 

As smoke starts to rise from the parchment, the rumbling grows closer.

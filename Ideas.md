Deep crow would be an AWESOME enemy to fight. 

The bagman would be an excellent boogeyman story to fight in 

a shapeshifter who has taken the place of a political person, and someone says they're not quite right. Could lead the party to a chase fight. 

swarm of books could be a good enemy to show awakening darkness. 

A slightly crazy man trying to get his giant goose to lay a magical egg. While the party watches, it lays a golden egg, only to contain one of the less powerful goose egg trinkets. The man goes nuts. 

Finding warforged in and outside a vault and reawakening them and recruiting them. 

Bring Sonorus into a game. Maybe have him sell some magical items, or hold secrets, or be some sort of unknown mysterious person

have chatgpt make taunting rhymes geared towards player characters

* An old man sits alone behind a massive mahogany desk in a windowless room. The desk is scattered with maps, candles, and crystal decanter of amber liquid. He sits with his head in his hands, as a rumbling in the distance causes ripples in the decanter. 
  He sighs, wets his quill, and scratches a signature into the parchment before him. As he leans back into his chair with a heavy sigh, the parchment starts to smolder and burn.

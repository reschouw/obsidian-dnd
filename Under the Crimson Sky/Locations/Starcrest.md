Starcrest served as the primary bastion against ancient evil. It was beseiged the most frequently, plundered the most often, and by the end of the war, it was almost entirely populated by soldiers. It's magnificent walls, once adorned with ballistae and catapults have since fallen into disrepair. The remaining population is extremely hardy and stubborn. 

- **Strategic Importance and Symbolism:** Even in disrepair, Starcrest holds immense strategic and symbolic value. Reclaiming and rebuilding it could serve as a rallying point for the three city-states, a testament to their renewed unity and determination.

- **Potential for Hidden Knowledge or Power:** The abandonment of Starcrest after the war might mean that crucial artifacts, hidden chambers, or forgotten defenses remain within its ruins. Discovering these could provide a significant advantage against the vampire.
